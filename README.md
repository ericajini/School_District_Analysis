# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of Analysis

During this review I did an entire analysis of a School District including a district summary, a school by school summary, the top 5 performing schools and the bottom 5 performing schools, the average math and reading scores for each grade level, the scores by school spending per student, the scores by school size, and the scores by school type. The school board also has evidence of academic dishonesty for the math and reading grades for Thomas High School, so part of this analysis includes removing those values and updating the overall percentages for that school to only include 10th - 12th grade scores.
